	   We can manipulate the data by :
			search
			sort
			insert
			delete
			update
	- every this is of object
	- no primitives only objects (Provide Wrapper Classes)
	- Provide set of implemented classes and interface

		  Interface      implemented class
		
			Set	         HashSet
		                 	 - unique data structure
		                    
		                 LinkHashSet
		
		
			list		ArrayList
		                  	- allow duplicate

						LinkedList
						Vector
						Stack
		                	- first in last out
		
			queue       PriorityQueue 
		                	- first in first out         
		
		
			Map         HashMap
							 - key value(pair of element)
		               LinkedhashMap
