What is a mutable String?
A String that can be modified or changed is known as mutable String. StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are used for creating mutable strings.

StringBuffer: public synchronized StringBuffer
    - StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. 
    - It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously
    - StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
    - StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0

StringBuilder: Asynchronized
    - StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. 
    - It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
    - StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
    - StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5

- Both will create an empty String Builder or String Buffer with the initial capacity of 16.
