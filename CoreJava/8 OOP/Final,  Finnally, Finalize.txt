Q. Hashing in Java:
	- Hashing in Java is the process of converting an object into a fixed-size hash code using the hashCode() method, 
		which helps in efficiently storing and retrieving data in hash-based collections like HashMap and HashSet.
	- It uses techniques like chaining or open addressing to handle collisions, ensuring fast lookups and insertions.
	- The hashCode() method is used to generate a hash code for an object based on its contents, which is used to determine its position in the hash table.
