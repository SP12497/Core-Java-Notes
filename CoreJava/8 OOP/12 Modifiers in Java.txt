		- public native void nativeMethod();
		- Declares methods implemented in native code (C/C++)
	strictfp
	transient
		- class TransientExample implements Serializable { private transient String password; }
		- The transient keyword prevents a field from being serialized when an object is serialized.
		- It is used for fields that are sensitive, temporary, or derived values that need not be stored.
	volatile:
		- private volatile boolean flag = true;
		- shared variable across all threads.
		- Changes made to a volatile variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads.
		- Without volatile, threads may cache variables locally, leading to stale values being read.
