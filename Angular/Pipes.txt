Pipes : https://blog.bitsrc.io/pipes-in-angular-4f979af63dd7
1 Pure Pipes:
	A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe.
2 Impure Pipes:
	An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameter(s) changes.

Create a class and apply @ Pipe decorator (without the space between @ and Pipe) to it and pass an object to the decorator which contains two properties:
- name (name of the pipe)
- pure (the optional property which determines the type of pipe, by default it is true, we can provide value as false to make pipe impure).

@Pipe({
	name: "append",
	pure: false
})
