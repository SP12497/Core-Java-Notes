Apache Kafka:
    - Apache Kafka is like a communication system that helps different parts of a computer system exchange data by publishing and subscribing to topics.
    - Working: Sender(Producer) --Publish--> Apache Kafka ==Subscribe==> Receiver1(Consumer)/Receiver2/Recceiver3 // multiple subscribers/consumers
    - Official Defn: Apache Kafka is an Open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines,
      streaming analytics, data integration and mission-critical applications.

Use cases:
    1. OLA Driver location update
    2. Zomato live food tracking
    3. Notification system to huge user

Use case 1. OLA Driver location update:
    - Update location of delivery boy in DB:
        -- check "use case 1..1 zomato use case via DB.png"
        - DB throughput (max request in minimum time) is less
        - Every seconds, db hits and store location of Delivery Boy and User will hit DB to get the location.
    - public location of delivery boy in Kafke:
        -- check "use case 1.2 zomato use case via Kafka.png"
        - DB throughput is high


Why:
    - High throughput
    - Fault Tolerance (Replication Technique)
    - Durable
    - Scalable
    - ...

Kafka Architecture:
    - 2. Kafka Architecture.png
    - ZooKeeper: Manages broker (kafka servers) states.
    - Broker: its a Kafka server. Broker's have multiple topics.
    - Topic: it haves multiple partitions.
    - Partition: it have multiple Offsets.
    - Offset: offset (0,1,2,..) is inside partition. Data stores inside Offset.

Installation:
    -- https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart
    1. Download Kafka zip file from official website.
    2. Extract file
    3. Start Zookeeper
    4. Start Kafka Server.
