1. Explain master - slave architecture of Jenkins:
->  - Jenkins master pulls the code from the remote GitHub repository every time there is a code commit.
    - It distributes the workload to all the Jenkins slaves(agents)
    - On request from Jenkins master, the slaves carry out builds and tests and produce test reports

2. What us Jenkinsfile?
-> It is a text file that contains the defination of a Jenkins pipeline and is checked into source control repository.

3. Command to run Jenkins from the command line:
    - java -jar Jenkins.war

4. What concept are key aspects of Jenkins pipeline?
->  a. Pipeline:
        - User defined model of a CD pipeline. Pipeline's code defines entire build process, that includes building, testing and delivering an application
    b. Node:
        A machine which is part of Jenkins environment capable of executing a pipeline.
    c. Step:
        A single task that tells Jenkins what to do a particular point in time.
    d. Stage:
        Defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire pipeline (build, test, deploy stages)

5. Which file is used to define dependenccy in maven?
    - pom.xml

6. Explain the two types of pipeline in Jenkins along with their syntax:
    - Scripted Pipeline:
        node {
            stage("Build") { step ""}
            stage("Test") {}
            stage("deploy") {}
    - Declarative pipeline:
        pipeline {
            agent any
            stages {
                stage("Build") { steps { }}
                stage("Test") {}
                stage("deploy") {}
            }
        }
7. What are the ways in which build can be scheduled/run in Jenkins?
    a. By source code management commits
    b. After completion of other builds
    c. scheduled to run at specified time
    d. Manual build requests

8. How to restart jenkins?
    - (Jenkins_url)/restart   // Forces a restart without waiting or build to complete
    - (Jenkins_url)/safeRestart   // Allow all the running build to complete before it restarts
