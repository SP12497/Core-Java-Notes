Router : InterNetworking Device
	- used to communication between 2 different network.
	eg. nw id1: 192.168.0.0 and nw id 2: 153.33.0.0

Switch :
	- used for communication between the same network
	- eg. id 1: 192.168.1.5 and id 2: 192.168.1.11
	
------------------------
IP's
1. Private IP / IPv4:
	- 10.0.0.0
	- 172.16.X.X
	- 192.0.0.0
2. IPv6
3. Subnetting :
	- network within network
	- logical division of IP address.

--------------------
Subnetting :
	- eg. suppose, we have a router and 2 different network is connected to the router.
	nw1 id : 10.0.0.0
	nw1 id : 130.10.0.0
	once we allot the nw id to the nw, then we can not allot the same nw id to another nw.
	eg. 130.10.0.0 is
		- 130.10 is first 2 octed is a network ID
		- and last 2 octed is a host ID
		and if only 20 devices is connected to the network.
		devices id will be : 130.10.0.1, 130.10.0.2, 130.10.0.3, ..... 130.10.0.20
		- total 16 bit is for the host and we only connectd 20 host to the network.
		2^16-2 = 65,534-20 = 65,514 host id's we can not used.
		- its wasting of IP's.
		- to avoid wasting of IP's, we used Subnetting
	- 10.0.0.0/8		: Class A 	: first octed for network ID
	- 150.50.22.33/16	: Class B	:	first 2 octed for network ID
	- 200.22.33/24		: Class C	:	first 3 octed for network ID
	- 8 / 16 / 32 is a CIDR id
