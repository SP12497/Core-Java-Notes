What is Docker?
    - Docker is a platform that helps developers build, share and run application with container.
    - A docker container has everything about a project like code,runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings with specific version.

Images:
    - are templates of project
    - It is king of ready-to-use software read-only templates
    - Images is made with source code, libraries, external dependencies and tools.
    - Images can not be updated.
    - If you want to make change in image, you have to create new image
    - Images can not run directly.
    - Image Example:
        - Application tools and Libraries: (Image can contains:)
            - Node js setup
            - React setup
            - code of application
            - dependencies
            - any other supporting tools
            - docker file too
            
Container:
    - Running Instance of Image
    - Project Image -> RUN -> Container
    - The container is a process that runs application with images.
    - Container is an isolated process.
    - Means container run independently on computer.
    - eg. Container 1 contain: node 18, Container 2: Java 17, Container 3: node 16

Docker Hub:

        2. Parent Image: 
            - like, node js, JDK, mongo
            - Sometimes project need another image of programming language or other library.
