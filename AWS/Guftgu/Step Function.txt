Step Function / State Machine:
- AWS Step Functions is a fully managed service that makes,
  it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.
- It allows you to build applications by arranging and coordinating individual steps as a series of states in a workflow.
- Each state represents a specific task or action that needs to be performed.
- Step Functions provides a graphical console to design and visualize your workflows.
- It supports various AWS services as steps in your workflow, such as AWS Lambda, AWS Batch, Amazon ECS, etc.
- You can also include error handling and retries in your workflows.
- Step Functions automatically tracks the status of each step and manages the execution flow based on the success or failure of each step.
- It provides built-in logging and monitoring capabilities to help you troubleshoot and analyze the execution of your workflows.

- Steps:
    1. Define the states: Each state represents a specific task or action that needs to be performed in the workflow.
    2. Define the transitions: Transitions define the flow between states, specifying the conditions under which the workflow moves from one state to another.
    3. Design the workflow: Use the visual workflow editor provided by Step Functions to design and visualize the workflow, arranging the states and transitions.
    4. Configure the states: Configure each state with the necessary input and output data, as well as any specific settings or parameters required for that state.
    5. Test the workflow: Test the workflow to ensure that it behaves as expected, verifying the correct execution of each state and the flow between states.
    6. Deploy the workflow: Deploy the workflow to the Step Functions service, making it available for execution.
    7. Monitor and troubleshoot: Use the built-in logging and monitoring capabilities of Step Functions to monitor the execution of the workflow and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Interview Topics:
