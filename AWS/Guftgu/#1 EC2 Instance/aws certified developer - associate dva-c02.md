The AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification is designed for individuals who have experience in developing and maintaining AWS-based applications. It covers a broad range of topics to ensure that candidates have the necessary skills to design, develop, deploy, and maintain applications on AWS. Here's a breakdown of the syllabus or domains covered in the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam, as well as the recommended roadmap to prepare for it:
# AWS Certified Developer - Associate Syllabus

The exam focuses on the following five domains:

1. **Deployment (22%)**
    - **Deploying applications on AWS:** Understanding deployment best practices and automating deployments using services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, and CloudFormation.
    - **Manage deployment processes:** Skills in CI/CD, setting up automated pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeDeploy, etc.
    - **Prepare application deployment:** Knowledge of packaging applications, preparing necessary resources for deployment, and handling scaling and failover.

2. **Security (26%)**
    - **Implementing security best practices:** Focus on IAM (Identity and Access Management), ensuring that resources and services are accessed securely.
    - **Application authentication and authorization:** Using AWS services like Cognito for authentication, SSO (Single Sign-On) integration, and managing credentials properly.
    - **Encryption:** Understanding how to encrypt data at rest and in transit using services like AWS KMS (Key Management Service) and SSL/TLS.

3. **Development with AWS Services (30%)**
    - **Serverless development:** Working with AWS Lambda for serverless applications, API Gateway, DynamoDB for serverless databases, and step functions for workflows.
    - **AWS SDK:** Familiarity with AWS SDK to interact programmatically with AWS services like S3, EC2, DynamoDB, etc.
    - **Message queues and notification systems:** Use of services like Amazon SQS, SNS, and Kinesis.
    - **Developing applications that consume AWS services:** Understanding how to utilize AWS services effectively in application development, e.g., using S3 for storage, DynamoDB or RDS for databases.

4. **Refactoring (10%)**
    - **Optimize applications for AWS:** Refactoring legacy applications to better take advantage of AWS services (serverless, microservices, etc.)
    - **Migration of applications:** Planning and executing the migration of applications to AWS with minimal disruption.

5. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting (12%)**
    - **Monitoring application performance:** Using services like Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting.
    - **Troubleshooting and debugging:** Identifying and resolving issues in a deployed AWS environment using services like X-Ray, CloudTrail, and Lambda logs.
