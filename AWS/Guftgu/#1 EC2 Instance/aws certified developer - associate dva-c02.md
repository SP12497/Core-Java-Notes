The AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification is designed for individuals who have experience in developing and maintaining AWS-based applications. It covers a broad range of topics to ensure that candidates have the necessary skills to design, develop, deploy, and maintain applications on AWS. Here's a breakdown of the syllabus or domains covered in the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam, as well as the recommended roadmap to prepare for it:

The exam focuses on the following five domains:

1. **Deployment (22%)**
    - **Deploying applications on AWS:** Understanding deployment best practices and automating deployments using services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, and CloudFormation.
    - **Manage deployment processes:** Skills in CI/CD, setting up automated pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeDeploy, etc.
    - **Prepare application deployment:** Knowledge of packaging applications, preparing necessary resources for deployment, and handling scaling and failover.

2. **Security (26%)**
    - **Implementing security best practices:** Focus on IAM (Identity and Access Management), ensuring that resources and services are accessed securely.
    - **Application authentication and authorization:** Using AWS services like Cognito for authentication, SSO (Single Sign-On) integration, and managing credentials properly.
    - **Encryption:** Understanding how to encrypt data at rest and in transit using services like AWS KMS (Key Management Service) and SSL/TLS.

3. **Development with AWS Services (30%)**
    - **Serverless development:** Working with AWS Lambda for serverless applications, API Gateway, DynamoDB for serverless databases, and step functions for workflows.
    - **AWS SDK:** Familiarity with AWS SDK to interact programmatically with AWS services like S3, EC2, DynamoDB, etc.
    - **Message queues and notification systems:** Use of services like Amazon SQS, SNS, and Kinesis.
    - **Developing applications that consume AWS services:** Understanding how to utilize AWS services effectively in application development, e.g., using S3 for storage, DynamoDB or RDS for databases.

4. **Refactoring (10%)**
    - **Optimize applications for AWS:** Refactoring legacy applications to better take advantage of AWS services (serverless, microservices, etc.)
    - **Migration of applications:** Planning and executing the migration of applications to AWS with minimal disruption.

5. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting (12%)**
    - **Monitoring application performance:** Using services like Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting.
    - **Troubleshooting and debugging:** Identifying and resolving issues in a deployed AWS environment using services like X-Ray, CloudTrail, and Lambda logs.

    - **Online Courses:** Platforms like A Cloud Guru, Udemy, and Coursera offer specific courses for the AWS Developer Associate exam.
    - **AWS Documentation:** Especially for services like Lambda, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, and IAM.
    - **Books:** AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate Guidebooks or Exam Guidebooks from authors like Neal Davis.

## Key Skills Required

- Proficiency in at least one high-level programming language (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.).
- Understanding of cloud-native applications.
- Experience with serverless architecture.
- Knowledge of CI/CD pipeline automation.
- Familiarity with container services (e.g., ECS, ECR, Fargate).

## Exam Day Tips

- Be comfortable with reading and interpreting scenarios in exam questions.
- Focus on best practices and the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
- Pay attention to services like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and CI/CD tools as these are core to the developer role.

## Passing Score for AWS Certified Developer - Associate Exam

The passing score for the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam typically ranges between 70% and 75%. However, AWS does not publish an exact passing score because the exam is scaled, and the required score may slightly vary depending on the difficulty of the exam version you take.

The exam is scored out of 1,000 points, and to pass, you usually need to score around 720-750 out of 1,000.

### Key Points

- The exam uses scaled scoring, meaning your raw score (the number of correct answers) is converted to a consistent scale.
- Each exam version may have different difficulty levels, which is why the passing score is not always the same.
- Aim for a minimum of 75% to ensure you pass comfortably.
