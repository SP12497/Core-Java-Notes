# Types of AWS Databases:

## 1. Relational Databases
Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) and are ideal for transactional applications that require ACID compliance.

- **Amazon Aurora**: A MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud.
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: A fully managed service for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.

## 2. Key-Value Stores
Key-Value stores are a type of NoSQL database that uses a simple key-value method to store data, allowing for fast retrieval of data by key.

- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed key-value and document NoSQL database designed for high availability and performance at any scale.

## 3. In-Memory Caching
In-memory databases store data in-memory for low-latency access, ideal for caching and real-time use cases.

- **Amazon ElastiCache**: A fully managed in-memory caching service that supports Redis and Memcached for real-time applications requiring sub-millisecond response times.

## 4. Graph Databases
Graph databases use nodes and edges to represent and store data, allowing complex relationships between data entities to be easily modeled.

- **Amazon Neptune**: A fully managed graph database service supporting both property graph and RDF graph models.

## 5. Document Databases
Document databases are a type of NoSQL database designed to store, retrieve, and manage semi-structured data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON format.

- **Amazon DocumentDB**: A fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads.

## 6. Time Series Databases
Time series databases are optimized for efficiently storing and querying time-stamped or time-series data.

- **Amazon Timestream**: A fast, scalable, and serverless time series database for IoT and operational applications.

## 7. Ledger Databases
Ledger databases provide an immutable and cryptographically verifiable transaction log.

- **Amazon QLDB (Quantum Ledger Database)**: A fully managed ledger database that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log.

## 8. Data Warehousing
Data warehouses are optimized for querying and analyzing large amounts of structured and semi-structured data.

- **Amazon Redshift**: A fully managed petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud.

## 9. Search Databases
Search databases are designed to index, search, and analyze large amounts of unstructured text and other types of data.

- **Amazon OpenSearch Service**: A fully managed service for OpenSearch and Elasticsearch, allowing search, monitoring, and analysis of real-time data.

## 10. Blockchain Databases
Blockchain technology allows decentralized and verifiable record keeping, useful in scenarios where trust between parties is essential.

- **Amazon Managed Blockchain**: A fully managed service to create and manage scalable blockchain networks.

## 11. AWS Glue Data Catalog (Metadata Repository)
While AWS Glue is a data integration service, its **Data Catalog** plays a key role in discovering and managing metadata from various databases and data lakes.

- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: A central metadata repository for data discovery and management.
