Integrity Constraits over relation:
-----------------------------------
- Its used to ensure accurancy and consistency of the data in relation database.
- Its a set of rules that the database is not permitted to violate.

Types of Integrity Constraits:
------------------------------
1. Domain Constraits	: on Attribute Condition/checks
2. Entity Integrity Constraits	: primary key null not allowed
3. Referential Integrity Constraits	: FK should be PK of other table or null
4. Key Constraits	: choose entity/column as Primary key which is unique and not null

================
1. Domain Constraits:
	- its defines the domain or the valie set of values for an attribute
	- Age: positive number
	- The data type of domain includes string, character, integer, time, date, currency, etc. The value of the attribute must be available in the corresponding domain.
	
2. Entity Integrity Constraits":
	- its states that primary key value can't be null

3. Referential Integrity Constraits: 
	- its specified between two tables.
	- its enforced when a foreign key references the primary key of the table.
	- its either primary key of other table or null.
	
4. Key Constraits: on Attribute
	- For Primary Key, (Unique and not null)
	- An entity set can have multiple keys or candidate keys (minimal superkey), but out of which one key will be the primary
