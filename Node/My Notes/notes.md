What is Nodejs?
    - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
    - Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side 
      to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the users web browser.
    - Single threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
    - Huge library of open-source packages available. Huge community support.
    
REPL:
    - Read, Eval, Print, Loop
    - Node.js comes with a built-in REPL environment. It performs the following tasks:
        - Read: Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.
        - Eval: Takes and evaluates the data structure.
        - Print: Prints the result.
        - Loop: Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.
    - REPL is used to test simple JavaScript expressions.
    - Practical: Open terminal and type "node" to start REPL.
    - "_": It contains the result of the last expression.
      eg. 2 + 2 ans is 4 
          _ + 1 ans is 5

Run Node.js file:
    - Create a file with .js extension.
    - Write JavaScript code in the file.
    - Open terminal and type "node filename.js" to run the file.
    - The file will be executed and the output will be displayed in the terminal.
    - Practical: Create a file named "app.js" and write console.log("Hello World") in it. Run the file using "node app.js".

readline module: (Read Input From User)
    - Java: Scanner class, C: scanf(), Python: input() function
    - Readline module is used to read input from the user.
    - It is a built-in module in Node.js.
    - Practical: Create a file named "readline.js" and write the following code in it.
*/
    const readline = require('readline');
    const rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout
    });
    rl.question('Enter a number: ', (num) => {
        console.log(`You entered: ${num}`);
        rl.close();         // emit close event to close the interface
    });
    rl.on('close', () => {  // We can listen to the close event to perform some action on close event.
        console.log('Readline interface closed.');
        process.exit(0);    // exit the process
    });

/*
fs module:
    - File System module is used to perform file operations.
    - It is a built-in module in Node.js.
    - Practical: Create a file named "file.js" and write the following code in it.
    - We can perform the following operations using the fs module:
        - Read file         : fs.readFile()     |    fs.readFileSync()
        - Write file        : fs.writeFile()    |    fs.writeFileSync()
        - Append file       : fs.appendFile()   |    fs.appendFileSync()
        - Delete file       : fs.unlink()       |    fs.unlinkSync()
        - Rename file       : fs.rename()       |    fs.renameSync()
        - Create directory  : fs.mkdir()        |    fs.mkdirSync()
        - Remove directory  : fs.rmdir()        |    fs.rmdirSync()
        - Read directory    : fs.readdir()      |    fs.readdirSync()
        - etc...
*/
const fs = require('fs');
// Read file:
// fs.readFile(path, encoding, callback);
fs.readFile('/Node/samplefile.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {   // read file asynchronously, utf8 is encoding, will get callback once file read is completed.
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(data);
});

// fs.readFileSync(path, encoding);  // is synchronous and blocks execution until finished
let textIn = fs.readFileSync('/Node/samplefile.txt', 'utf8');   // read file synchronously
console.log(textIn);

// Write File:
// fs.writeFile(path, data, callback);
fs.writeFile('/Node/samplefile.txt', textIn + '\nHello World!', (err) => {   // write file asynchronously
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File written successfully.');
});

#11 Routing:
    - Routing defines the way in which the client request are handled by the application endpoints.
    - We can make our application to respond to different URLs with different response using Routing.
    - Routing basically means implementing different actions for different URLs.
    - Url Patterns:
        - File based url pattern: 
            - http://localhost:3000/about.html
        - Resource based url pattern: http://localhost:3000/user     || /user/123
            - Route Parameter:
                - www.example.com/books/:category/:language
                    eg. www.example.com/books/programming/javascript
                    read data from url:
                        req.url => /books/programming/javascript
                        req.params.category => programming
                        req.params.language => javascript
            - Query String / Query Parameter:
                - www.example.com/books?category=programming&language=javascript
                    read data from url:
                        req.query.category
                        req.query.language


#22 Streams in Node.js:
    - With Streams, we can process data piece by piece instead of reading or writing the whole data at once.
    - Advantages of Streams:
        - Memory Efficient: Streams are memory efficient because they process data in chunks.
        - Performance: Streams are fast because they process data in chunks. No need to wait for the whole data to be read or written.
        - Time Efficient: Streams are time efficient because they process data in chunks.

    - Types of Streams:
        1. Readable Stream:
            - used to ready data chunk by chunks from a source.
            - events: data, end, error, close
            - fs.createReadStream(), http.request()
            - methods: read(), pipe(), unpipe(), unshift(), resume(), pause()
           - Example 1:
            server.on('request', (req, res) => {
                    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
                    readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
                        res.write(chunk);
                    });
                    readStream.on('end', () => {
                        res.end();
                    });
                    readStream.on('error', (err) => {
                        console.error(err.message);
                        res.statusCode = 500;
                        res.end(err.message);
                    });
                });
            - Example 2:
                const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
                readStream.pipe(res);   
                // no need to listen to data, end, error events. It will automatically handle these events. 
                // Removes boilerplate code.
                // readStream.pipe(writeStream);  // pipe data from readStream to writeStream.
        2. Writable Stream:
            - used to write data chunk by chunks to a destination.
            - events: drain, finish, error, close
            - methods: write(), end(), cork(), uncork()
        3. Duplex Stream:
            - used to read and write data together in chunks.
        4. Transform Stream:
            - used to modify or transform the data while reading or writing.
            - eg. zlib.createGzip(), zlib.createGunzip()

#27 Architecture of NODE JS:
    - V8 JavaScript Engine: (C++ and JS)
        -> converts JavaScript code into machine code.
    - Libuv: (C++):
        -> handles asynchronous operations.
        1. Event Loop:
            - tasks like timers, I/O operations, and callbacks.
            - Handles asynchronous operations
        2. Thread Pool:
            - heavy tasks, like file system operations, file compression, and cryptography.
            - by default, the thread pool size is 4. We can increase or decrease the size of the thread pool upto 128.
            Windows: `set UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=10`
    - HTTP Parser: (C) => Parse HTTP requests and responses
    - C-ares: (C)   => Handles DNS queries
    - OpenSSL: (C)  => Provides SSL support
    - Zlib: (C)    => Provides support for gzip compression
    
Process:
    - program in running state is called process.
    - Every process has One Main Thread.
    - Node.js is single threaded which uses this Main Thread.

Node js process:
    - Main Thread: Single Threaded
    - Event Loop: Handles asynchronous operations
    - Thread Pool: 
        - all heavy operations like file system operations, network operations are not handled by the main thread.
        - In node.js, we can not create multiple threads. We can only create child processes.
