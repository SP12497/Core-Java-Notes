### Listing installed versions

To list the installed versions of Node.js, use the following command:

```
nvm list
```

### Switching to a specific version

To switch to a specific version of Node.js, use the `use` command followed by the version number. For example, to use version 16.20.2, run:

```
nvm use 16.20.2
```

### Installing a specific version

To install a specific version of Node.js, use the `install` command followed by the version number. For example, to install version 20.11.1, run:

```
nvm install 20.11.1
```

### Setting a default version

To set a default version of Node.js to be used whenever a new shell is opened, use the `alias` command followed by the version number. For example, to set version 20.11.1 as the default, run:

```
nvm alias default 20.11.1
```

### Uninstalling a version

To uninstall a specific version of Node.js, use the `uninstall` command followed by the version number. For example, to uninstall version 16.20.2, run:

Remember to restart your shell after making any changes to ensure the changes take effect.
